TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks ref_clk and tck are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ref_clk] -to [get_clocks tck]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks tck and ref_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks tck] -to [get_clocks ref_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks ref_clk and tck are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ref_clk] -to [get_clocks tck]

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT u_ibex_demo_system/u_top/core_clock_gate_i/gen_generic.u_impl_generic/valid_q[2]_i_6 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
